          Black panthers are known for their exceptional night vision, which is
          six times better than that of humans. This gives them a significant
          advantage when hunting and navigating in low-light conditions.

          The term "black panther" typically refers to a melanistic color
          variant of leopards (Panthera pardus) or jaguars (Panthera onca),
          where their normally spotted or rosetted coat appears almost entirely
          black due to an excess of dark pigment melanin. Despite their dark
          appearance, these big cats still retain their species'
          characteristics, such as the body structure and behaviors of regular
          leopards or jaguars. Black panthers are not a distinct species but
          rather a genetic variation within the populations of these two big cat
          species.
